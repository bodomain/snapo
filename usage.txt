# Pomodoro CLI Application

A simple command-line interface for the Pomodoro technique, written in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `simpleaudio` library
- `coin.wav` (included in the project directory)

## Installation

Before running the application, install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: On Linux, `simpleaudio` may require development headers for ALSA. You might need to install `libasound2-dev` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `alsa-lib` (Arch Linux).

## Usage

Run the application using Python:

```bash
python pomodoro.py [options]
```

### Command-line Arguments

| Argument | Long Form | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-w` | `--work` | Work session duration in minutes | 25 |
| `-b` | `--break` | Short break duration in minutes | 5 |
| `-lb` | `--long-break` | Long break duration in minutes | 15 |
| `-c` | `--cycles` | Number of work cycles | 4 |
| `-h` | `--help` | Show help message and exit | N/A |

### Example

To start a session with 20 minutes of work, a 10-minute short break, and 4 cycles:

```bash
python pomodoro.py -w 20 -b 10 -c 4
```

## Notification Sound

- The application plays `coin.wav` using the `simpleaudio` library at the end of each work and break session.
- If the sound fails to play (e.g., missing audio drivers or library), it will fall back to a terminal bell sound (`\a`).
